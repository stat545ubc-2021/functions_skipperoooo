# sumstat

The goal of sumstat is to provide a function that takes in a data.frame and a numerical column in that dataframe and outputs a data.frame of summary statistics (mean, median, max, min, standard deviation, and count), as well as a histogram of that column's distribution with a vertical line representing the mean.

## Installation

sumstat is not yet on CRAN, but you can download it from this repository using the following R command.

``` r
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2021/functions_skipperoooo")
```

## Example

This example uses `summary_stats_column` on the `mpg` column of the `mtcars` data.frame to create summary statistics and a histogram.

```{r example}
library(sumstat)
summary_stats_column(mtcars, mpg)
```
